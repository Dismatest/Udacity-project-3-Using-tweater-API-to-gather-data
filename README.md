# (Ford Gobike Data Exploration)
## by (Bill Clinton Ogot)


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.The data was downloaded from https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv. The data required multiple data files to be joined for wrangling and cleaning.

> The fordgobike dataset has about 183412 rows and 16 columns. The colmns are compost of different datypes for example; numerical, datetime, object and boolean. Some of the colums are are follows; duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude ,end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year and much more.


## Summary of Findings

> From the above visualizations i have able to see that trip duration is dependable to some features such as age. As the subscibers and customers become older the trip duration reduces.

> Both customer and suscribers are showing a simmilar trend for some variables such as age, duration, and user_type.


## Key Insights for Presentation

>  The trip duration takes six hundred seconds to ahieve a higher peak values where the large amount of values are concentrated. the peak value starts at zero then drips until there is no peak value.
> What i observed from the plots is that age is dependent on the trip duration for example the trip duration increases as the participant gets older. On the other hand, start station and end station doesnt determine the trip duration hence they are independent to the trip duration.
